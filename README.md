# Server-Client
A server-client architecture is a common pattern in network programming where a server program listens for incoming connections from client programs, and then establishes a connection with each client to exchange data.

In this architecture, the server typically has a fixed IP address and listens on a specific port for incoming connections. The client program initiates a connection to the server by specifying the server's IP address and port number.
Once a connection is established, the client and server can exchange data.
